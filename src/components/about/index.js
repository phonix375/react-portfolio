                <p>I'm a web designer and front/back-end developer and I love what I do!
I began my journey with everything that has to do with computers, from building computers from parts to 3D modeling and even working on video game mods.
In the last 2 years, I found my passion for web design and development! Started by teaching myself from video tutorials on youtube throw online courses from the Georgia Institute of Technology and Harvard online and now I'm enrolled in a Bootcamp at the University of Toronto and I LOVE IT!</p>
